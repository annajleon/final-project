## Front Matter

```{r}
# clean up workspace environment
rm(list = ls())

# all packages used for the assignment
library(DataComputing)
library(readr)
```

## Data Access

```{r}
NYC <- read_csv("AB_NYC_2019.csv")

head(NYC)
names(NYC)
```

```{r}
glimpse(NYC) 
```

## Data Wrangling

I am dropping variables id, host_name, last_review, and minimum_nights because they are not relevant to my analysis.
```{r}
NewNYC <-
  NYC %>%
    select(name, host_id, neighbourhood, neighbourhood_group, latitude, longitude, room_type, price, number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month, calculated_host_listings_count, availability_365)
NewNYC
```

```{r}
BoroughAvgPrice <-
  NewNYC %>%
    group_by(borough = neighbourhood_group) %>%
    summarise(avg_price = round(mean(price, na.rm=TRUE))) %>%
    arrange(desc(avg_price))
BoroughAvgPrice
```

```{r}
NYCwAvg <-
  NewNYC %>%
    left_join(BoroughAvgPrice, by = c("neighbourhood_group" = "borough")) %>%
    rename(avg_price_in_borough = avg_price)
NYCwAvg
```


## Data Visualization

```{r}
NewNYC %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=longitude, y=latitude)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = room_type))
```
